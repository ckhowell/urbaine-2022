For many years, a salesperson’s focus has been transactional rather than value driven. While this may have formerly looked like a sure-fire way to win a sale, it was really a fast-track to losing sales volume and an eventual decline in market share. 

The new sales model needs to shift the focus from saving money to greater benefit from good product and skilled sales. To do this, I will give you a 7 Day Guide to implementing vital new techniques. 

### Day 1: Conduct on-the-spot buyer analysis 

Firstly, take a good look at how your client buys. Ask what is important to them, what drives them to spend, and how this aligns with your values? Are you listening closely enough instead of thinking about what to say next?

While market forces can and do change, your teams’ values need to be clear and focused. Give them a customer-centric script to build on and encourage them to sell your product and brand.

### Day 2: The best buy is NOT always the cheapest 

Consider this; if you focus on value rather than price you will always gain margin. To do this, you must maintain a constant, hard line and show that you believe in your product and identity. Start with some in-depth market research by taking a thorough look at how your goods and services compare, as well as the features and benefits that clearly identify you.

### Day 3: Problem solving builds optimal client solutions

Sometimes we make assumptions about why our customer will spend instead of listening and identifying their main reasons for buying. A good sales professional can assist by diagnosing needs through asking the right questions and using consultative selling techniques. More than ever in the current economic climate, part of their job description should be to challenge and comfortable asking difficult questions. 

### Day 4: Selling value over price - Play to your strengths 
Now is the time to consider unique strengths, clear sales messaging and whether solutions are adequately customer-focused. Many of us do not ask ourselves these simple questions: Why should they buy from me? Why not focus on price over value? Am I the salesperson who likes to discount because I focus on this when spending? As a sales professional you need to consider that every individual has a different mentality when spending. Think about this before offering a discount and go back to value instead.

### Day 5: Processes equal confidence 
Many companies do not have a sales process. This can be a big roadblock when selling value. You need a milestone-centric sales guide built around providing benefits rather than savings. It starts with asking enough open-ended questions that lead the buyer to discover their own value in the purchase. It also requires feeling comfortable discussing money. Finally, it covers resisting the temptation to answer your own questions. 

### Day 6: Speaking the customer’s language
A positive sales posture will create trust and respect and allow you to ask difficult questions easily. This is critical as customers buy on emotion. If you can deliver satisfaction to them through consultative selling skills, you will provide them with the outcome that they want. Also carefully consider the timing of the conversation and ensure that you only quote when the client is ready.

### Day 7: Selling value over price - the bottom line 
All businesses want to improve their bottom line. However, if your sales professionals are not incentivised and focussing on providing client solutions, then this can be a major handicap to performance. The key to optimising results is well-developed sales systems and processes, constantly re-assessing and being able to adapt. 

The formula is simple – shift the focus from PRICE and concentrate on VALUE.  To succeed in today’s market, you need to move the conversation permanently away from budget and instead look at the right language, new skills and brand belief.
